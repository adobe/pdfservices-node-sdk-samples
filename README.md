# Samples for the PDF Services Node.js SDK

This sample project helps you get started with the  PDF Services Node.js SDK.

The sample JS scripts illustrate how to perform PDF-related actions (such as converting to and from the PDF format) using 
the SDK. **Please note that the PDF Services Node.js SDK supports only server side use cases.**

## Prerequisites
The sample application has the following requirements:
* Node.js : Version 10.13 or above. Node installation instructions can be found 
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


## Authentication Setup

The credentials file and corresponding private key file for the samples is ```pdfservices-api-credentials.json``` and ```private.key``` 
respectively. Before the samples can be run, replace both the files with the ones present in the downloaded zip file at 
the end of creation of credentials via [Get Started](https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/gettingstarted.html?ref=getStartedWithServicesSdk) workflow.

The SDK also supports providing the authentication credentials at runtime, without storing them in a config file. Please
refer this [section](#create-a-pdf-file-from-a-docx-file-by-providing-in-memory-authentication-credentials) to 
know more.

## Quota Exhaustion

If you receive ServiceUsageError during the Samples run, it means that trial credentials have exhausted their usage quota. 
Please [contact us](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdftoolsapi_requestform) to get paid credentials.

## Build with npm

Run the following command to build the project:
```$xslt
npm install
```

Note that the PDF Services SDK is listed as a dependency in the package.json and will be downloaded automatically.

## A Note on Logging
For logging, this SDK uses the [log4js API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/log4js) . 
Upon running, the SDK searches for a file ```config/pdfservices-sdk-log4js-config.json``` in the working directory, and reads the
logging properties from there. If no configuration file is provided, default logging, i.e. logging INFO logs to the console is enabled. The clients can change the logging settings as per their needs.

## Running the samples

The following sub-sections describe how to run the samples. Prior to running the samples, check that the configuration 
file is set up as described above and that the project has been built.

The samples code is available under the ```src``` folder. Test 
files used by the samples can be found in the ```resources``` folder. When executed, all samples create an ```output``` 
child folder under the project root directory to store their results.

### Create a PDF File
These samples illustrate how to convert files of some formats to PDF. Refer the sdk documentation of create-pdf-operation.js 
to see the list of all supported media types which can be converted to PDF.

#### Create a PDF File From a DOCX File 

The sample script ```create-pdf-from-docx.js``` creates a PDF file from a DOCX file.

```$xslt
node src/createpdf/create-pdf-from-docx.js
```

#### Create a PDF File From a DOCX File with options

local file, it writes the result to an output stream.

```$xslt
node src/createpdf/create-pdf-from-docx-to-output-stream.js
```

#### Create a PDF File From a DOCX File (By providing in-memory Authentication credentials)

The sample script ```create-pdf-with-inmemory-auth-credentials.js``` highlights how to provide in-memory auth credentials
for performing an operation. This enables the clients to fetch the credentials from a secret server during runtime, 
instead of storing them in a file.

Before running the sample, authentication credentials need to be updated as per the instructions in the script. 
```$xslt
node src/createpdf/create-pdf-with-inmemory-auth-credentials.js
```
